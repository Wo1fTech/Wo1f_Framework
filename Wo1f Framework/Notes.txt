Notes

Make the Socket handle all the communications (sending/handling/encryption over networking so each connection is a different encryption)
Make the Client be an inheritable class for clients that handle the connection and have an option to automatically communicate with the database and add commands.... also add a switch/default type thing for the commands for unknown commands....
