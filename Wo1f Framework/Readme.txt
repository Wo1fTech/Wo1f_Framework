Wo1f Framework has been developed by Wo1f

The reason I made this framework was to make wrappers for many common jobs I found myself doing in so many different applications.


Features and planned features:
***Automation***
"Script" to easily and dynamically compile text into a C# 'script' to run as a program
image matching calculation //todo
image gathering and handling
Control over WebBrowser(RS bot)
other bot tools

***Files***
File updating (for launcher/patchers)
Self updating
"FileSystem" for loading, handling, and caching files into memory a/synchronously for quick loading

***Winapi***
Control over common win32, user32, and kernel32 API functions

***Diagnostics***
DLL Injection
Native process function hooking//todo
easy access to things like HWID, and performancequery objects.
Registry tweaks for basic things like fix CDR, hide/show files, windows gui fixes, right click, and things for bypassing school security :P

***Memory***
Dynamic variables for handling objects based on strings(Var)
Dynamic events for commands based on strings (Networking.Command)

***Networking, Databases and stuff***
Get local IP Address, network statistics
"Database" for handling MSSQL and MySQL connections and simplifying commands (Query, Insert, Update)
Socket for networking and handling TCP/UDP using the bytes or the Packet class
"Client" for handling Sockets and account data (like logging in with accounts)

***Programs I made and bundled with the framework as Forms and resources***
Wo1f Search: recursively search through folders to find a file based on name or contents using multiple threads
Wo1f Injector: Inject DLLs and monitor process/module/thread information
Wo1f Task Manager: Monitor processes and their modules/threads as well as give the ability to pause and unpause and kill programs.  I used this to manually find and remove viruses
Wo1f Chat Client: My take on an IRC-like program Client version
Wo1f Chat Server: My take on an IRC-like program Server version
Netuse: Show network usage over different network interfaces
